What is React?
.React is a one of the most popular JavaScript libraries that is used to develop interactive user interfaces

Features of React
--------------------
.JSX   -- JSX makes it simple and easy to create applications.
.Virtual DOM
.Testability
.Server-Side rendering
.One-Way Data Binding(DOM --> Component)

Important Concepts
---------------------
Components: In React everything is a component.Different component are used to make up a single application.
State and Props: 
State: 
.State are the source of data
.They determine the object behaviours
.Can have lifecycles
Props:
.Props are read-only components
.They are passed from parent to child
.Help maitain unidirectional data flow

Keys:
.Keys are provide identity to components
.They help us distinguish between elements
.Serve to keep tract of items

Debugging:
.React uses compile time debugging to detects errors.This ensures that errors don't silently turn up at run-time.
 Facebook's unidirectional data flow allows clean and smooth debugging. fewer stack traces.

Event Handling:
.Event handlers are used to manage events such as mouse clicks.hovers.etc.


Aspects of ReactJS
--------------------
.Virtual DOM
.Data Binding         --> ReactJS follows unidirectional data flow or one way data binding
                          Throughout the application the data flows in a single direction which gives you better control over it
.ServerSide Rendering --> Server-Side rendering allows to pre-render the initial state of your react components at the server side only


Advantages of ReactJS
---------------------------
.Application performance is increased
.Used on client as well as Server Side
.Readability is Improved
.Easily used with other frameworks
